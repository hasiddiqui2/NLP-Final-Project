Sanjay,"I've been a proud user of the Oppo Reno 10X Zoom - the fastest phone on the market when I bought it (well, faster than the Samsung equivalent and had a better camera). 4-years later it's still going strong but the battery is now barely a day so looking for an upgrade. Surprisingly the pop up cameras are still fully functional and used dozens of times a day. However, the Find X6 Pro has definitely piqued my curiosity ",2 days ago

Fettuccine,"I really liked that leather era of phones, now everything has to be a glass sandwich with sharp metal rails, my favorite phone designs were the LG G4, and the iPhone 5c, both phones were not going for a premium feel but they both felt incredibly premium and beautiful in their own way, I would love to see more ""unapologetically plastic"" phones in the future lol just imagine a 15 pro Max with the same design as the 5c unibody plastic",2 days ago

pseudo nym,"It's amazing how far phone cameras have come hardware wise.

Susindhran Sridhar,"Imagine making the OnePlus flagship with this form factor mainly the circular camera bump with almost stock like Android UI.. that would be a nice deal, the only deal breaker for me in these Chinese phones are UI.

I think X6 has found their original idea to make a flagship to be only TOP  at least in one spec, and X6 now has the best camera and brightest screen.

Luke B,"As an S22 Ultra user, I do find myself a little jealous of these camera specs. They aren't a clean sweep beating Samsung in every area - the 10x periscope zoom is still such a cool camera feature and very fun to use. But I am very impressed with the larger sensors for the ultra-wide and 3x telephoto. The ultra-wide on the S22 Ultra certainly isn't bad, as far as phone ultra-wides go it's at the top end of the market but there still is a noticeable quality drop when switching from the main camera. So boosting the sensor size whilst also having the same aperture will make a big difference. I'm guessing all of the cameras on this phone pixel bin down from 50MP to around 12MP in default settings - that would make sense, enabling a 4:1 pixel binning. Seen as most higher end phones do this I'm sure the Oppo does too - they will want to get the most out of this lovely big sensor, and 12MP is easily enough for a normal photo that has already been framed with the desired zoom level.",1 minute ago
Mark One,"Damn, what a phone!! I love companies that do these new things and try to be unique! Oppo is not a company I know a lot about, but the X series has been on my radar this past year!

BariumCobaltNitrog3n,"Hasselblad set the gold standard for cameras with Zeiss lenses when film was a thing. They made primarily medium format twin lens (2 1/4 or 120 and 220). The camera bump is the size of the lens and the film (now its a sensor) was the size of a credit card. I doubt they make any part of this phone, just renting the name. Maybe consult.",2 days ago

PNW Meditations,"Re: Battery. With the advent of wireless charging, the subjective experience for me is that by phone feels like it has infinite battery. With chargers that double as desktop stands, nightstands, car mounts, etc - places where I'd set my phone down anyway, it's just a thing that always has juice. Bonus points that I'm not wearing out the charging port on my phone.",3 days ago

Noah Bersier,"I was planing to get this phone, but as it's not coming to Europe, I just got myself the s23 ultra. The only thing that is a bit annoying is the slow charging of about 1 hour untill full. Oppo and Xiaomi are better there. However, Apple and Google take one hour more.... I did not get a Xiaomi because of the bad update support and I don't like the software. But at the s23 ultra the camera, software, s pen, display, fingerprint reader and the fast software updates are great. Plus the battery life with the 8 gen 2 for galaxy is amazing 10 hours of screen on time and about 1.5-2 days of ussage is no problem. So i don't mind charging it for about an hour.",3 days ago (edited)
Ian Thomas,"Despite the impressive features of this phone, I still feel like new devices need new functionalities - I foresee satellite connectivity becoming a new arms race relatively soon. I would also be interested in things like bringing back IR blasters, more ports, radio-based local communication (walkie-talkie style or like a local network), maybe a laser rangefinder... I would happily accept a phone that is twice as thick as current devices if it had features like these. Making devices massively more robust, rugged, and capable of longevity is another thing I am interested in too.",3 days ago

Lumma's Travels,"The latest phones are impressive but, they simply don't blow me away. Like you said, when phone screens went 300dpi and you could no longer see the pixels, what's the point of going further? The last giant leap forward I had with phones was when I switched from IPhone 5 to Samsung S7, the bigger screen and better camera was incredible. Next I went from S7 to Note 8 and it was just the full front screen without the home button. Next was the Note 10 I'm still using and when I went back to the 8 for a short while when I had a broken screen I hardly noticed any difference. Newer phones have removed features that i care about (headphone jack, SD card expansion). I'll probably hold onto this until it no longer receives updates.",3 days ago

Traveler Volkriin,I remember when we were LUCKY to get 8 hours on a single charge on a smartphone. NOW we'd be taking it back to the manufacturer for a defective model.

Dylan Michael,"I think Marques addressed like the sole big issue in smartphones right now in like a minute. I think it's mind blowing that in 10-15 years the only standard for battery is at most ""all day"". Even that is getting kind of weary because we can just fast charge it if it doesn't last all day. Logically smartphone manufacturers like this because it's more charge cycles at higher temperatures you put on your phone wearing it down faster. The real focus needs to be getting to a true 2-3 day battery life and beyond. Most companies won't though because it means consumers would upgrade their phones less often. It's the same logic and method behind why the light bulb industry actually limited the longevity of bulbs in order to maintain consistent sales.",3 days ago

PixelRacer,"Been waiting for you to say the first 30 seconds for a long time, but hey you got to make videos. I hope you have a backup job, cause we already see that except for 20% of Americans. We don’t really care, 90 hrtz is plenty, your eyes can’t see between 90 and 120. Same for the rest. We use to charge overnight now a few, mostly you guys are making a big deal about super fast charging is so important. I sleep 5 hrs per night, as long as it’s charged after 5 hrs and it last all day, I’m good. Display again we are getting at a point where it’s plenty good, eye doctor have looked at the difference on the pixel pro, again maybe 1% can after 5 minutes of staring see difference, otherwise it’s a game that phone companies play with (brighter, more white) but pixels you can’t see those. 5G we have to wait many yrs, but if .5 seconds is slow for you. Keep making videos but the end is coming where all we will care about is price and built quality. Want great pictures, get a camera. 200mp doesn’t give you a better photo. Most billboards are 3mp, 12mp is a must for pro photographer along with anything around 60mp. But thanks for the first 30 seconds, smartest thing said in a long time, until they can put weeks on those phone. Personally if I could keep my S 10  till it breaks, I would be happy. I was offered a new Pixel at 1/2 price through connections. Took it but as a back up for now. I already have a camera that takes way better pictures than any phone. So phone with internet access, great plan with 100 gb per month + unlimited talk and text including long distance (that’s has important if not more than the phone) what’s the point of a $1500 Apple iPhone if all you got is 4gb, no unlimited calls or long distance, useless !

themrjones,"Software on cell phones has just caught up to where custom ROMs were 8 years ago. So funny. This girl does anybody remember the Galaxy S5 days with the custom ROMs where it had the walking mode? Where would overlay a camera shot over? Anything you were doing on your phone so you could essentially just go about your day walking but you could see in front of you and you could still do what you need to do on your phone. It had both images on the screen at the same time overlaid over top each other. Plus overclocking, underclocking, under volting, CPU and GPU. Hell they had a toggle for everything, hell it feels like we are going backwards. Pixel phones rite, you open the camera, switch it to video because I never take pictures. I only take videos. Go back home or go to another app real quick and then go right back into the camera. And what does it do it switches from the video to the camera. I didn't close out the app so it shouldn't restart. Why does the camera restart every time I go into it?. Google your tripping. We don't have a toggle for the 5G so we could turn that on and off real quick. Charging slow as hell. I mean this s*** is crazy. I swear I had my old phones clocked almost three gigahertz that was 8 years ago. And I remember my phone running so much better than phones these days.",3 days ago

Yeah I get the evolution of hardware/software we've faced from the past few years, but that could easily be talked about in ANY smartphone video, or just a discussion video in general, like you always do... somehow you used this to praise a specific smartphone that by far, does not represent such advancements, I mean, yes it's a new phone so it brings some exciting stuff, but let's be honest, there's nothing special about it, there's nothing that the title suggests, almost all of its features are present in other phones as well, or will be in the really near future. This is as boring as a phone can be. And that's coming from a person who owned the Find X5 Pro for about 4 months, got excited at first but realized there's not much in there at all. And about the design, come on... I know that visuals is personal, each to their own... but comparing this ugly camerabump with the previous gen (Find X5 Pro) is a huge sin. At least the X5 Pro was sleek, was unique and had amazingly beautiful curves... this one is just boring AND ugly AND repetitive (Xiaomi 12S Ultra, Oneplus 11, Huawei Mate 50 Pro, Vivo X90 Pro, etc).",3 days ago
